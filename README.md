In this project we have built many classification models (Decision tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Xgboost,logistic regression) to predict whether the tumor is benign or malignant and then we introduce a comparison between three algorithms in terms of accuracy. Python was used a tool for building this classification models and for measuring the accuracy. From the accuracy figures we have found that Xgboost algorithm gives the best accuracy figures when compared to other models.we have also used RFECV(Recursive feature elimination with cross validation) technique to find the important features in our dataset.
